<h1> Small Apps </h1>

This is a collection of small fun apps that I will be creating to improve my skills on Python!

# Password Manager (panager)

# Flash Cards Application 

I created this app, because I am really bad at learning languages. I hope it will help you as much as it helped me!

# Rainapp

A fun small app that will send you a text message if there is going to be rainy at your area!

# Nutriapp

This is an app using [nutritionix api](https://www.nutritionix.com/business/api) in order to add your exercise data in a google sheet. You can use natural language to explain what you did.
For example:

`I run 30 mins and walked 1 hour.`

This will create 2 entries in the sheet. One will be Running 30 mins with x amount of calories and the second will be Walking 60 minutes with y amount of calories!

# Flight tracker

This is a basic flight tracker I created while experimenting with APIs. It checks the prices for some destinations I would love to visit and creates alerts for my phone and email.

# Movie Titles Scraper

Just a simple scrapper of a website that creates a movie list with the top 100 movies according to them.

[Movie Titles Scraper](/movies_scrapper/readme.md)

# Top 100

This application is designed to create a Spotify playlist based on the Billboard Hot 100 songs for a given date. It scrapes the Billboard Hot 100 website for song titles and searches for these songs on Spotify. If found, it adds them to a newly created private Spotify playlist.
