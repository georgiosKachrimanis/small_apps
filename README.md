<h1> Small Apps </h1>

This is a collection of small fun apps that I will be creating to improve my skills on Python!

# Flash Cards Application 

I created this app, because I am really bad at learning languages. I hope it will help you as much as it helped me!

# Nutriapp

This is an app using [nutritionix api](https://www.nutritionix.com/business/api) in order to add your exercise data in a google sheet. You can use natural language to explain what you did.
For example:

`I run 30 mins and walked 1 hour.`

This will create 2 entries in the sheet. One will be Running 30 mins with x amount of calories and the second will be Walking 60 minutes with y amount of calories!
