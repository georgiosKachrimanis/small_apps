# Password Manager

A simple password manager built using the `tkinter` library in Python. This application allows users to store and retrieve login information securely.

## Features:

1. **Generate Random Password**: Easily generate a strong password which combines letters, numbers, and symbols.
2. **Save Login Information**: Save your login information (Website, Username/Email, and Password) securely.
3. **Search for Passwords**: Quickly retrieve your password for a specific website.
4. **Intuitive GUI**: The application offers a user-friendly interface for easy navigation and use.

## Usage:

1. Run the program.
2. To generate a random password, click on the "Generate Password" button.
3. Input the website, email/username, and password information.
4. Click the "Add" button to save the login details.
5. Use the "Search" button to find the password for a specific website.

## Prerequisites:

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- `tkinter`
- `pyperclip`
- `json`
- `random`

## Note:

- The saved data will be stored in a JSON file named `p422_w0r6.json` inside a folder named `panager`.
- Ensure the folder `panager` exists in the same directory as the script, and you have an image `logo.png` inside the `panager` folder for the application logo.
